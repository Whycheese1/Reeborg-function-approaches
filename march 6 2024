#Basic funcition approach
#completes a task
#def gotopole():
#    repeat 6:
#        move()
#        
#gotopole()

#data input approach
#completes a task based on unput of variable data
#def go_to_goal(distance,speed):
#    think(speed)
#    for x in range(distance):
#        move()
#
#go_to_goal(6,50)

#return_approach
#does a task and returns data out if the function:
#def steps_to_take():
#    return 6
#
#def go_to_goal(distance):
#    for x in range(distance):
#        move()
#        
#steps = steps_to_take()
#go_to_goal(steps)
